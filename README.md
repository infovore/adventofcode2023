Advent of Code 2023
===================

Mainly written in mediocre Typescript, but as an opportunity to flex some muscles.

## Installation

    pnpm install

## Running an exercise

From the root of this repository:

    tsx 01/pt1.ts 01/input.txt

## Strategy / approach

In general, I'm prioritising readability and expressiveness over golfing, terseness, performance optimisation. Leaning towards a functional-ish approach, with rich objects that mean things, over classes or endless arrays.
